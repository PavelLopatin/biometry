# Frontend

## How to use

### Setup

1. Create `.env` file by copying data from `.env.example`:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

### Run

```sh
npm run start
```

Or for Windows:

```sh
npm run win-start
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

### Development

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Available Scripts

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.
